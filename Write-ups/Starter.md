## Details

Hello there! We're so glad you're able to help us thwart DEADFACE this year. Let's get you spun up on where to get started.

We found out DEADFACE is likely targeting a company called De Monne Financial. They've targeted them in the past and based on some OSINT research, we're sure they're targeting De Monne again this year.

One of our partners found a forum page where DEADFACE discusses their activity. We managed to gain access to the forum and opened it up to be viewed publicly, but you won't be able to create an account. The forum site is called Ghost Town. There's a lot of information on this forum that might help you.

> Thanks for participating in this year's DEADFACE CTF! Before you begin, please take a look at our rules and submit the flag found on that page. Submitting the flag is an acknowledgement of the rules and your compliance. Thank you and enjoy the CTF!
