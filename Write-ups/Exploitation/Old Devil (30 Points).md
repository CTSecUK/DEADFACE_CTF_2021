Running the progrm we see the following;
```
❯ ./demon

Luciafer v1.0
Say the demon's name to gain access to the secret.
Enter the demon's name: 123

That is not the demon's name.
```

Lets try that again with `ltrace`

```
❯ ltrace ./demon
puts("\nLuciafer v1.0\nSay the demon's n"...
Luciafer v1.0
Say the demon's name to gain access to the secret.
)                                                   = 66
printf("Enter the demon's name: ")                                                              = 24
gets(0x7ffcfee67621, 0x559d7e90406a, 0, 0Enter the demon's name: 123
)                                                      = 0x7ffcfee67621
strcmp("123", "Adrammelech")                                                                    = -16
puts("\nThat is not the demon's name."
That is not the demon's name.
)                                                         = 31
+++ exited (status 0) +++

```

We can see here that the program is calling a string compare function `strcmp()` agaisnt the value we entered `123` and compareing it to another string `Adrammelech`.

`strcmp("123", "Adrammelech")`

Lets try again using taht string as the deomns name;

```
❯ ./demon

Luciafer v1.0
Say the demon's name to gain access to the secret.
Enter the demon's name: Adrammelech

You are correct.
flag{AdraMMel3ch}
```

## flag{AdraMMel3ch}
