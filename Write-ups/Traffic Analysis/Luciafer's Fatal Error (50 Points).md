Removing the `FTP` filter and looking at the packets which follow, we can ssee the folloowing in the `TCP stream`

This appears to be launching a shell.

As before if we then re-filter by `ftp-data`, select the packet relating to `secret-decoder.bin` and extract and save it from the `TCP Stream`.

Now that we have a copy of the file on our local machine we can run;

```bash
‚ùØ md5sum secret-decoder.bin
42e419a6391ca79dc44d7dcef1efc83b  secret-decoder.bin
```

## flag{42e419a6391ca79dc44d7dcef1efc83b}
