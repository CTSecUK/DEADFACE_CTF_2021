This time we filter the packet capture by `ftp-data`

Scrolling through the packets we can see;

First we select one of the packets relating top the file `lytton-crypt.exe` and `Follow TCP Stream`;

Then we change the data to be in `RAW` format

And click the  `Save as...` button saving the file as `lytton-crypt.exe`

We then repeat the process for the `lytton-crypt.bin` file.

Select one of the packets relating top the file `lytton-crypt.bin` and `Follow TCP Stream`;

Then we change the data to be in `RAW` format

And click the  `Save as...` button saving the file as `lytton-crypt.bin`

Now we have both files exported, we can run;

```
‚ùØ md5sum lytton-crypt.*
8a84e7153aa083b66cd89c652bef27da  lytton-crypt.bin
9cb9b11484369b95ce35904c691a5b28  lytton-crypt.exe
```
